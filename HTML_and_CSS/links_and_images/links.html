        <h1>Links</h1>

        
        <p>This is an example about links and <a href="images.html">images</a>.</p>
        <p>This particular page is about links! There are three kinds of links: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Absolute links,like to
              <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">Mozilla
                Developer Network</a>,which is a very good resource for web developers.<br>
                It’s possible to use absolute links to refer to 
                pages in your own website, but hard-coding your 
                domain name <br>everywhere can make for some tricky situations. 
                It’s usually a better idea to reserve absolute links <br> 
                only for directing users to a different website.
            </p>
            </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Relative links point to another file in your website 
              from the vantage point of the file you're editing. <br> It's 
              implied that the scheme and domain name are the same 
              as the current page,so the only thing you <br>need to supply
              is the path. Relative links, like to our <a href=misc/extras.html>extras page</a>.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Root-relative links point to the root of our website.
                    Root-relative links, like to the <a href="/">home page</a> of our website, <br>
                    but those aren't useful to us right now.
                </p>
            </li>  
        </ul>
